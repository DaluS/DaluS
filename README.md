## Post-doctoral Researcher at the Environmental Justice Program, Georgetown University



## Previous Work 

### PhD in interdisciplinary physics: self-organisation of macroscopic organism in their mechanical environment
* "form, formation, deformation of G. ventalina"
* Under the direction of Stephane Douady (MSC Paris VII) and Pascal-Jean Lopez (MNHN)
* Ph.D. defense can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8WHax_zYaI
* Ph.D. Manuscript can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FfOLBS5w3ydCyeVIUP8ySjOUAUt3k-in/view?usp=share_link

#### Library developped

`PySkelWays` is a python library of image analysis, network extraction, hyper-graph construction and hyper-graph analysis. It has been created to study 2D reticulated spatial networks, and can be used on various subjects (Gorgonians, cracks patterns, leaves, dragonfly wings, cities network, jellyfishes, hyphal growth...)

#### Description of the PH.D., through the manuscript chapters 

*How can we read the complex shape of corals ? What are its geometrical and mechanical properties ? What can they tell us about their environment ? How do they appear, how can we decompose the shape as an ensemble of simple growth processes coupled together ? What does those growth processes tell us about the ability of Gorgonia ventalina to acclimate its environment ?*



###  Reaction-diffusion growth models with depletion applied to diatoms
* Under the direction of Julien Derr (MSC Paris VII)
